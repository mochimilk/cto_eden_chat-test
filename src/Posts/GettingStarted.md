# Aesop's Fables

## 1. The Tortoise and the Hare

Once upon a time, there was a hare who mocked a slow-moving tortoise. Tired of the hare's arrogance, the tortoise challenged him to a race. The hare, confident in his speed, agreed. 

When the race began, the hare dashed off and, certain of his victory, decided to nap. Meanwhile, the tortoise continued plodding along, slowly but steadily. When the hare woke up, he realized the tortoise was near the finish line. The hare sprinted, but it was too late. The tortoise had already crossed the finish line.

**Moral:** Slow and steady wins the race.
